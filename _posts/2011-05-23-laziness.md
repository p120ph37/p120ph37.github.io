One of my [friends](http://www.brianmorehead.com) has a habit of
posting obfuscated strings as Facebook comments when he gets bored.
Being [lazy](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris), I don't
usually feel like spending my time doing things like converting binary
to decimal or hex<!--more-->
[by hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation#Base_conversion)
and then looking up values in an
[ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) table.  So to elucidate
these comments I choose to employ one of the most obscenely obtuse
mechanisms available: the [Perl
one-liner](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-p101/).

{% highlight sh %}
perl -e'print pack("B*",<>)' # convert binary to ascii
perl -e'print unpack("B*",<>)' # convert ascii to binary
{% endhighlight %}

So, Brian, now that [your secrets have been
exposed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma),
what are you going to do about it?  I eagerly await your next
obfuscated post...
