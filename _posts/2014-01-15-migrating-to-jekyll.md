I've maintained this blog off and on for a few years now on a self-hosted
WordPress instance, but that has felt a bit bloated and unwieldy to me.
(Especially the awkward WYSIWYG post editor) so I've begin porting the blog
over Jekyll, hosted on GitHub.  It's currently a work-in-progress, but I've
made it far enough to push out an initial version while I work on migrating
the remaining posts, porting the Disqus comments, tuning the CSS, and
writing about the experience.

More to follow soon!!!
